# The Alto Recorder

The recorder is a vertical (duct) flute made of wood and comes in various sizes:

- Garklein recorder in C6, range: C6–D8 (up to G8)  
- Sopranino (piccolo, descant) in F5, range: F5–A♭7 (up to C8)  
- Soprano recorder in C5, range: C5–E♭7 (up to G7)  
- Alto recorder in F4, range: F4–A♭6 (up to C7)  
- Tenor recorder in C4, range: C4–E♭6 (up to G6)  
- Bass recorder in F3, range: F3–E5 (up to A♭5)  
- Also: great bass and sub-bass recorders (in C and F), ranges: C3–E♭5 and F2–G4 respectively

Notation:  
Octave-transposing (transposing instruments),  
except in solo literature for the alto recorder, which is typically written at sounding pitch.

Playing techniques:  
Legato (smooth), staccato (detached), with much breath noise (sibilando, sputato), “white noise” (soundless air), overblowing (harmonics), etc. — the recorder is a highly agile instrument.
